PROMPT START:

I'm setting up automated equipment ordering for my smart home installation business. I need to integrate with multiple vendor APIs to automate product searches, pricing comparisons, and direct ordering. Please guide me through setting up API access for each vendor step-by-step.

**Business Details:**
- Company: Home2Smart (smart home installation services)
- Order Volume: ~50-100 equipment orders per month
- Average Order: $200-500 per job
- Equipment Types: Security cameras, smart locks, mesh WiFi, thermostats, doorbells, sensors
- Current Vendors: Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe's (manual ordering)

**Technical Setup:**
- Backend: Google Apps Script (JavaScript)
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL
- Current Features: AI equipment list generation, multi-vendor selection, order workflow

**APIs I Need to Set Up:**

1. **Amazon Product Advertising API (PA-API 5.0)**
   - Purpose: Search products, get pricing, check availability
   - Use case: Automated product search by keyword, real-time pricing
   
2. **Amazon SP-API (Selling Partner API)** 
   - Purpose: Order management for Amazon Business accounts
   - Use case: Create orders programmatically, track shipments
   
3. **Home Depot Commercial/Pro API**
   - Purpose: Product catalog, store inventory, commercial pricing
   - Use case: Check local store inventory, same-day pickup scheduling

4. **Lowe's Pro Services API**
   - Purpose: Product search, pro account management
   - Use case: Price comparison, pro pricing tiers

5. **(Optional) ADI (Alarm Detection Inc) Dealer API**
   - Purpose: Professional security equipment supplier
   - Use case: Trade pricing on cameras, access control equipment

**For Each Vendor API, Please Provide:**

1. **Account Requirements**
   - What type of business account do I need?
   - Are there minimum order volumes or fees?
   - Do I need a tax ID/business license?
   - What verification documents are needed?

2. **Step-by-Step Setup Process**
   - Exact URL to apply for API access
   - Forms to fill out
   - Information required (business details, use case description)
   - Approval timeline (how long until I get access?)

3. **API Credentials & Authentication**
   - What credentials will I receive (API keys, secrets, tokens)?
   - Where do I find them after approval?
   - How do I authenticate requests (OAuth, API key header, etc.)?
   - Are there sandbox/test environments?

4. **Rate Limits & Restrictions**
   - How many API calls per minute/hour/day?
   - Are there usage costs or fees?
   - What operations are allowed?
   - Any prohibited use cases I should avoid?

5. **Code Implementation Guidance**
   - Sample API request for product search
   - Sample response structure
   - How to handle pagination
   - Error handling best practices

6. **Testing & Validation**
   - How do I test without placing real orders?
   - Sandbox credentials if available
   - How to validate my setup is working

7. **Compliance & Legal**
   - Terms of service I must follow
   - Data usage restrictions
   - Attribution requirements (logos, disclaimers)
   - Privacy policy requirements

8. **Support Resources**
   - Developer documentation links
   - Support contact if I get stuck
   - Community forums or Slack channels
   - Known issues or common pitfalls

**My Specific Questions:**

A. **Amazon Setup:**
   - Do I need both PA-API (Product Advertising) AND SP-API (Selling Partner)?
   - Can I use PA-API to search and SP-API to order, or is there overlap?
   - Do I need an Amazon Business account vs. regular seller account?
   - What's the Associate Program tag and do I need one?

B. **Home Depot:**
   - Is API access only for suppliers, or can service businesses get it?
   - Do I need a Pro Xtra account first?
   - Can I access store-specific inventory via API?

C. **Lowe's:**
   - Same questions as Home Depot
   - Is their API as robust as Home Depot's?

D. **ADI:**
   - Do I need to be an approved security dealer first?
   - What are the requirements to become an ADI dealer?
   - Can I get API access without a physical storefront?

**Implementation Priority:**

Please help me set these up in this order:
1. Amazon (highest volume, easiest setup)
2. Home Depot (local inventory important)
3. Lowe's (price comparison)
4. ADI (if time permits and requirements are reasonable)

**Expected Output:**

For each vendor, give me:
- ✅ Checklist of prerequisites
- 📝 Exact steps to apply for API access
- 🔑 How to obtain and store credentials securely
- 💻 Sample code to make my first API call
- ⚠️ Common mistakes to avoid
- ⏱️ Realistic timeline for approval

**Additional Context:**

- I'm comfortable with JavaScript and REST APIs
- I can handle OAuth flows if needed
- I have a registered LLC with EIN
- I have commercial insurance
- I already order regularly from these vendors (just want to automate it)

Please be as detailed as possible, including screenshots or links where helpful. If any vendor doesn't offer public API access, suggest alternative solutions (web scraping, browser automation, third-party services, etc.).

Start with Amazon PA-API setup since that's my priority #1.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Copy everything from "PROMPT START" to "PROMPT END"
2. Paste into ChatGPT (GPT-4 recommended for detailed technical guidance)
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions it provides
4. Save all API credentials in Google Apps Script > Project Settings > Script Properties
5. Test each API in sandbox/test mode before going live
6. Come back to update the dispatch system with the credentials once obtained

ESTIMATED TIMELINE:

- Amazon PA-API: 1-2 business days approval
- Amazon SP-API: 3-5 business days (requires business verification)
- Home Depot: 1-2 weeks (requires commercial account setup)
- Lowe's: 1-2 weeks
- ADI: 2-4 weeks (dealer application process)

TOTAL SETUP TIME: 2-4 weeks for all APIs

Once you have the credentials, you'll add them to Script Properties:

AMAZON_API_KEY = [from Amazon Developer Console]
AMAZON_SECRET_KEY = [from Amazon Developer Console]
AMAZON_ASSOCIATE_TAG = [from Amazon Associates Program]
HOMEDEPOT_API_KEY = [from Home Depot Developer Portal]
HOMEDEPOT_ACCOUNT_ID = [your commercial account ID]
LOWES_API_KEY = [from Lowe's Developer Portal]
LOWES_PRO_ID = [your Pro account ID]
ADI_DEALER_ID = [your dealer number]
ADI_API_KEY = [from ADI Developer Portal]

After that, we'll wire up the backend functions to actually use these APIs for automated ordering.
